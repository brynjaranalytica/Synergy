# Synergy
Synergy is a multi-user project management system which is based on SCRUM, a popular framework for organizing team work. The main features of the app include chat, calendar and organizer and of course users can create common groups to share all of the information.

The code base is a pure Java. The whole system is built as an cliet-server application using MVC pattern on both client and server sides.
The application data is persistent on the server thanks to the connected SQL database, powered by PostgreSQL.
