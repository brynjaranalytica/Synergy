# Synergy
One of the critical responsibilities in any organization working with projects is project management. Project management is applied in numerous variations of projects, spanning from software system development to the advanced development of reusable space rockets. However, many organizations are seemingly not able to consistently manage projects effectively. Projects are often completed late, over-budget, or without meeting the functionality requirements of the customer.

Synergy is a multi-user project management system which is based on SCRUM, a popular framework for organizing team work. The main features of the app include chat, calendar and organizer and of course users can create common groups to share all of the information.

The code base is a pure Java. The whole system is built as an cliet-server application using MVC pattern on both client and server sides.
The client-server communication are powered by Java RMI. The application data is persistent on the server thanks to the connected SQL database, powered by PostgreSQL. 

You can find all detailed information about the code design in 'Documentation' folder, including UML diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and more.
